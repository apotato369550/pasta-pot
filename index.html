<br>
<br>
<p> Welcome to the Pasta Pot!!!, where creepypastas of many kinds are made!!!.</p>
<br>
<p> This website is for many various creepypastas that will horrify and entertain you at the same time,
and will make you look at your life, childhood, and the internet in a totally different and scary way.</p>
<br>
<p> You don't know what a creepypasta is? Well, think of it as a short story with a purpose to scare the reader, 
it is usually in a horror genre; no, it <em>has</em> to be in a horror genre. Basically, it's like a campfire story,
circulating through the internet. Got it? Okay.</p>
<br>
<p>This website is mostly for adults only, so, if you are still young, I would not suggest reading any of the creepypastas
listed in this website, and I also recommend getting out of here.</p>
<br>
<p> There are many types of creepypastas out there, some related to the internet, ghosts, rituals, good, and bad, 
but this website will have the creepypastas that i like the most so please don't judge me.</p>
<br>
<p> I will try to update every so often with more creepypastas so stay tuned!!!</p>
<p style="text-style: italics;">Note: these creepypastas are not mine and that this is a sample website.</p>
